nonincluded_ccc_explanation = you did not select one or more concerns, related by dependency or positive contribution, in the same execution of the identification unit. This may cause the non-identification of existing concerns in this software. To solve this issue, simply add these related concerns in the next execution of the identification unit.
nonidentified_ccc_explanation = you selected one or more concerns, related by dependency or positive contribution, however, some concerns were not identified in the requirements of this software. This may be occurred due to: (i) the set of keywords designed by the identification of these concerns is poor; (ii) the requirements document is omitting some important information; or (iii) these concerns may be implicit ones, that is, they are not explicitly mentioned in the requirements document. To solve this issue, check the list of concerns and the software requirements.  
pos_neg_contribution_explanation = there are concerns simultaneously impacted in a negative and positive ways by other concerns. To solve this issue, it is necessary to make a decision on what concern must be considered in this software. To do this, it may be needed to meet the project stakeholders.
neg_contribution_explanation = there are concerns negatively impacted by other ones. Please, take this into consideration during the software development.

# keyword hints
hint_kw_wildcards_title = Search with wildcards

Example: the keywords "test" and "text" are captured by the expression "te?t".</li><li>"*": keywords that contain zero or more characters at the position where the wildcard is. Example: the keywords "tests" and "tester" are captured by the expression "test*".</li></ul>These wildcards may be used in any position of a keyword, except in its beginning.
hint_kw_similarity_title = Search for similarity
hint_kw_similarity_body = Similar keywords may be found from a search for similarity. This type of search uses the well-known algorithm "Levenshtein Distance", that returns a value between 0 and 1, where the more the value is closed to 1 the more similar are the compared words. To use this resource, the researcher must append the "~" symbol at the end of the keyword of interest, along with the threshold required to accept another word as similar to its. For instance, "roam~0.5" will capture keywords which the "Levenshtein Distance" is equal or higher than 0.5, such as the keyword "roma".
hint_kw_logic_title = Search with logical operators
hint_kw_logic_body = The usage of "AND", "OR" and "NOT" logical operators in a keyword is allowed. For instance, the keyword "(pay OR payment) AND reservation" retrieves all software requirements that contain either the keywords "pay" OR "payment" AND the keyword "reservation", at the same time. Logical operators and wildcards may be combined into the same keyword, hence, the previous keyword could be re-written as "pay* AND reservation".
